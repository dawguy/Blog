# What to do next 2023-04-29

The constant struggle.

1. Immediately start on the startup idea.
    Part a) Front-end work.
    Part b) Back-end work.
    Part c) Desgn work.

2. Pick up the probability text book and make programs + blog posts to help me understand.

3. Rust book

4. More exercise + WoW.

5. Datomic practice.

6. Start writing for the blog.

7. Quantum physics text book (and all required relearning math to get back to the point where I'd be able to pick this up)

## What I'm feeling like doing

1.c., 2., 3.

Don't feel like doing design today. But design work + probability textbook sounds like a great combo.

Until I feel like the design is complete I'll probably start toying with the rust language as well since anything ranked #1 in most loved languages is probably worth learning based on how much I enjoy Clojure.

## Woot! 

Decision has been made.

Once design looks good I'll figure out how to implement it, and what constraints I want to look out for. Will be interesting to go from a place of pre-implementation design to implementation and write about it the whole time

# (Note to past David)

Ended up the next day feeling like quitting rust and going to Clojure. Gonna do design once I get everything pretty much built on the backend.

In retro retrospect, the easiest way to do this probably would've been to use a hard-coded .edn file representing a simple planogram. But I feel like what I'm currently doing of product list -> planogram GETs -> front-end is probably not too much more difficult and will be easy enough to implement that I don't waste much time compared to doing design up front.
