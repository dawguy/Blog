More accurately: https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom

Maelstrom feels like a really good way to get my head around the distributed system algorithms and implementations. + Get rid of some of the fear of the unknown.

Unsure why, but this topic makes me scared. Its like I'm being asked to do something completely bonkers and I domn't know where to start in the slightest.

I have the feeling that I could probably get past that fear, but its hard especially since this won't be applicable to almost anything that I'd plan on writing/working on in practice.
