Not going to implement this right now. But had a fun idea if I wanted to refacto everything. Essentially being able to pass CLI arguments for auto choosing an option would be dope.

Something like

bb src/microservice-navigator.clj 1 1

Where first 1 is "Open all" option
Second 1 lines up with the "Home" sub-option (or whatever is first)
