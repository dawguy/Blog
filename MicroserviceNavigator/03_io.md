Hitting some weird race conditions where the entirety of a for loop is being skipped as soon as a (read-line) is called

```clojure
(defn provide-options [targets]
  (if (empty? targets)
    (prn (str "No valid repo targets found. There were " (count microservice-mapping) " microservices listings checked."))
      (do
        (prn "-----------------------------------------")
        (prn "Select the microservice you wish to open:")
        (prn "1: All")
        (for [i (range 2 (+ (count targets) 2))
              :let [t (get targets (- i 2))]]
          (prn (str i ": " t)))
        (read-line)
        )))
```

I'm expecting this blog post to help out. http://yellerapp.com/posts/2014-12-11-14-race-condition-in-clojure-println.html


But it ends up that the simpler option was to use the fact that the (for) macro returns a lazyseq and make it into one big string ahead of time instead of trying to do 5 separate prints.
```clojure
(defn provide-options [targets]
  (if (empty? targets)
    (prn (str "No valid repo targets found. There were " (count microservice-mapping) " microservices listings checked."))
      (do
        (prn "-----------------------------------------")
        (prn "Select the microservice you wish to open:")
        (println (apply str "1: All\n"
                  (for [i (range 2 (+ (count targets) 2))
                        :let [t (get targets (- i 2))]]
                    (str i ": " t (if (not= (inc (count targets)) i) "\n")))))
        (read-line)
        )))
```

Overall after getting the above apply str method working everything else fell into place.

The one concern I still have is related to how the let variables are being used. I feel like I'm kinda cheating the functional part of the programming since I'm setting lots of variables sequentially, and not really making use of lazyseqs.

Getting a better understanding of how/when/what to use lazyseqs for would be quite informative.

What I'm thinking might make sense for them is separating the (read-line) from the printing. That way the printing can evaluate the lazy-seqs just in time, but at the end of the day this will probably look a lot like what I currently have I think?
