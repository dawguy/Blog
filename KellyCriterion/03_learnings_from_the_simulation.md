Overall biggest learnings I've had so far is that even with tremendous odds, bet sizes really don't go over 80%. I plugged in the values for what I'm hoping somewhat reflect what a couple stocks I'm following might do.

One of them recommended betting low 70% while the other was low 60%.

Despite giving most likely very very generous odds to myself, and the events currently occurring being very unique opportunities. Betting 100% wasn't recommended in the slightest.

Definitely going to take this into account in the future.
