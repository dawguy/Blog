Next up on the list is getting editing working.

The things I expect to need:
* Editing versions of the Chance component
* Way to refer to what is being changed
* On-change and on-event listeners

A while back I saw these tutorials from lamdaisland.com:
* https://lambdaisland.com/episodes/reagent
* https://lambdaisland.com/episodes/reagent-2-cursors
* https://lambdaisland.com/episodes/reagent-3-keys-lifecycle-methods

For editing the cursors is most important. (With some basic knowledge of how react works from earlier projects in jsx) 

Essentially what needed to be done was creating cursors, snippets of an atom which can be viewed and swapped nearly the same was an atom, from the atoms. And then add the editing + delete buttons to the side.
