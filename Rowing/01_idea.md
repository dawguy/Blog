# Project Goals
* Improve my golang abilities.
* Create a fully functioning athlete and boat tracking system intended for rowing coaches.
* Use technologies that are interesting I don't have existing experience with.

Since I have no plans to monitize this, turning it into a coaching simulator at some point would be pretty neat as well. Where you plan workouts and improve your athletes using the same tools I'm building for hopefully the real world.

# Early Technologies Planned

## Postgres
Postgres will be the bottom level database used for storing all workouts and other information.

## Docker
Docker will be the primary way that I plan to deploy the app and its dependencies.

## Golang
All services will be written in golang.

## D3
Charts and graphs will all be written in D3.

## Kafka
This one would just be cool to have for passing around workouts. Maybe could make a case for streaming workouts piece by piece.

## Solr
Would like to have a better understanding of this. It seems like solr works primarily as a search engine, so I'll likely have the most success just popping this on after implementing basic functionality.
