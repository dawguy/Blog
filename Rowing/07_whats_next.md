# What's Next

A little bit of pre-planning as the plumbing is in place.

## Available Tasks
* Front-end designs
* Focus on building workouts & inputting workouts
* Focus on simulation aspects
* Focus on trying to think of how you'd use workouts to compare boats

# So far the only one that makes sense is Focus on building workouts & inputting workouts.

Ideas:

* Have empty workout add split
* Have planned workout and fill in power data

What would a planned workout look like.

Probably a flag on the workout.

Ability to be cloned for a given athlete. Then each sequence can have its power updated independently from each other.

Need to be able to redo sequnce splits
