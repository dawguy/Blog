Made a fun little router as a break from the reagent half!

Was quite fun, but I feel like the code is hard to follow. I might want to go back to this in the future.

Essentially my goal was to get the target page so I can use a derefed app-db atom to control what page shows up.

From URL:

Get target page and parse all supplied params into a map. I think I succeeded in both of these.
