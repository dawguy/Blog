# Implementing Casandra Requests

Was a lot more similar to SQLite than expected, needed very few cassandra specific changes.

The one big challenge I faced was that the results weren't being returned from the exectue command. This still hasn't been solved, but I don't have access to a computer with enough memory to run Cassandra (laptop's disk is filled) so I'll be moving on and returning to this later.
