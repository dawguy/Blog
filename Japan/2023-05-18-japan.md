# Japan Day 8

# Morning

Himeji! Found out we could book tickets on shikansen from the screens. Made it a really easy process.

Himeji had a cute mascot of the castle as a plushie.

# Snoopy Store

Bought some souveniers.

# Train Ride Home

Bentos! I had tonkatsu with rice.

# Dinner

Indian food that night.

Huge naan, but wasn't great.
