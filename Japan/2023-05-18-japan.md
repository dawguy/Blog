# Japan Day 8

Looked for a lower walking day as we did a lot the last week. So we went to Himeji isntead of Universal Studios like originally planned. Univesral seemed like it would be a little too intense for how we were feeling. Super Mario World seemed neat but I'm happy with our choices.

# Morning

Himeji! Found out we could book tickets on shikansen from the screens. Made it a really easy process.

Himeji had a cute mascot of the castle as a plushie.

Interestingly Himeji was mostly a keep for weapons. The entire town was surrounded by walls, so the part we explored (5 levels extremely steep stairs) was mostly a last resort defense.d

# Snoopy Store

Bought some souveniers.

# Train Ride Home

Bentos! I had tonkatsu with rice.

# Dinner

Indian food that night.

Huge naan, but wasn't great. The 4.7 stars lied :'(
