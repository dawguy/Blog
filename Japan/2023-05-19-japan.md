# Japan Day 9

# Morning

Came back to Tokyo!

Richmond Hotel Premier Tokyo Oshiage

Touching the Tokyo Sky Tree. The sky tree itself is huge and the bottom 5 floors are a huge shopping complex.

Took an uber due to rain, driver was extremely kind + helpful. Worried about tipping moeny since I wanted to leave a big tip, but Uber app came in clutch and allowed us to tip virtually instead of in person.

# Back

Still raining. Took taxi, very helpful.

Saw giant golden carrot, roughly the size of a cruise ship. (Google says its a flame) on top of a building.

# Lunch
