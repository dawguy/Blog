# Flight

2023-05-11

We made it! The connection was tight (we needed to stop at a store and made it to line in boarding group 4)

Overall nothing too noteworthy this day.

## Subway

Made a mistake of not getting a suica card asap. The ticket process + navigating the trains without really understanding how to read maps made me buy an incorrect ticket (forgot the transfer). SHould've just ubered.

(Future days the suica card makes transportation feel very easy).

Overall took forever from landing to our hotel, but we got there and survived.
