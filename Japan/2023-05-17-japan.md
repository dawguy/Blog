# Japan Day 7

# Morning

Woke up early and got to Fushimari with all the gates at 7:30-8. Not too many people and no shops were open except for one touching the station.

Walked up the hill.

# Imperial Villa

Most beautufil garden. The landscaping intentionally had hills and curves going into the ponds/mountainside. So it was a combination of manicured trees + flowers + rock paths and curves. Felt quite truly like the emperor who set it up had a perfect sense of beauty.

Reservation required, so took up a lot of time. We showed up around 11:45 and had to wait for a tour at 1:30pm. 

# Waiting To Go In

Walked back to town, bought some pizza + baguette from a local shop and then sat in a Colorado coffee shop (but very temporarily as smoking was allowed).

# Imperial Villa Experience

Was hot, Naomi didn't enjoy the amount of walking in the heat, but I found the scenery worth 100%. It felt expansive and manicured. While there we saw several of the evergreen trees being trimmed to make them remain small and look like large bonsais. Its hard to describe the imagery without photos, but the whole time I just felt like this was a place of relaxation and peace.

We had 2 1L pocari sweats and 2 liters of water with us at all times.
