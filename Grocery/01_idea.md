# Idea

Basic idea here is to take the grocery store experience and put it into the browser.

## Pre-code Validation

Gonna do some pre-coding validation for this idea. In particular it seems like figma? would be a decent fit.

Already snapped some photos from a local grocery store.

### Figma Is Hard

From the pre-code validation I'm sensing that this will be very hard to do well from an iPhone.

I do have a suspicion that its mostly due to my impatience with Figma.

Edit: Ends up that Figma without a mouse is hard. With a mouse and sense of creating frames for everything that should be the holder of content makes it feel quite natural.
