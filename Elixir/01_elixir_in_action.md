# Starting off with elixir in action.

Working through the book.

# IDE Support

See 02_nvim setup as once I got this setup it made it so much easier/more fun.

# Comparison With Clojure

So far iex doesn't hold a candle to Clojure's REPL, but will keep trucking away since the language itself seems pretty fun. 

# Future Plans

* Look at Pheonix
* Read Concurrent Data Processing in Elixir
* Read Adopting Elixir: From Concept To Production
* Make stuff!
